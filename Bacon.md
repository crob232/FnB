Yield: 20 Slices

Ingredients:
- 20 Slices of Bacon

Steps:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
2. Layout 10 slices of bacon, with no overlap. 
3. Place on top rack of the oven, in the middle of the rack. Set a timer for 8 minutes and press start
4. After the timer alarm goes off, turn the pan around, and place on bottom rack. This prevents the bacon from cooking unevenly. Set timer for another 8 minutes, press start.
5. After alarm goes off again, remove from oven. Bacon is done when a foam of bacon grease forms over the top of the bacon. Place in a safe place to allow the bacon to rest for 5 minutes.
6. Once bacon has rested for 5 minutes, place in appropriate pan

Note: Bacon grease is drained into the HDW grease bucket, or the grill grease bucket.
